## Exploration

All the other crimes appear to follow the same pattern


District 7 and 8 had the most crimes in 2022

District 31 had the least crimes in 2022



July and August have the most crimes
February has the least crimes



## Recommendation

More resources should be allocated to Theft compred to Narcotics in the next six months.

Theft is predicted to have more than 8 times the number of criminal counts than Narcotics.

This is further illustrated by the widely varried percentage changes in the 6 month forecasts.
- **Theft** is predicted to increase by **44.74%**
- **Narcotics** are expected to uncrease by **2.60%**
